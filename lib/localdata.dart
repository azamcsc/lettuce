The disease is most common in warm, humid weather, and can lead to reduced growth and yield, as well as poor quality heads. Symptoms include white, powdery spots on the leaves and stems, yellowing of leaves, and leaf distortion.\n\n How to control:Crop rotation: Avoid planting lettuce in the same location for consecutive seasons, as this can lead to a buildup of the fungus in the soil.Sanitation: Remove and destroy any infected plant debris to prevent the fungus from overwintering and spreading.\n\n\nAir circulation: Proper air circulation can help to reduce humidity and prevent the fungus from spreading.Fungicide: Use fungicide that is specific for powdery mildew and follow the label instructions carefully."
